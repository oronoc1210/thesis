I obtained the directory containing example fastqs 'test_data' from the course blackboard,
and modified existing fastqc and trimmomatic scripts (also from the blackboard) to take the input dir
as a positional argument. 

I then ran fastqc_script.py and trimm_script.py on the test_data directory, creating the output directories
fastqc_out, which contains all of the fastqc output files, and 
trim_out, which contains all of the trimmomatic output files.
